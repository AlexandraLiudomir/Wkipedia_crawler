# Wkipedia_crawler
test task
I did not get what the task authors meant saying "application settings", but anyway decided not to make a UI. 
So I 've made xml-file "settings" and put it into /src. In this file one can adjust following parameters
- crawling threads count
- period for the same thread to make new queries
- categories names
- path to resulting files
-resultin CSV-file name.
Sorry for not handling any exceptions.
